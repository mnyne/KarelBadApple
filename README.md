Code that was used to animate Bad Apple in the Stanford version of Karel the Robot. As input, pre-processed frames of Bad Apple as binary black/white 50x38px images were used. 
Some logic used for preparing the dataset was generated by AI, as this was a first semester project.

Additional code not included in this repository was used for taking a screenshot whenever Karel completed a frame.
